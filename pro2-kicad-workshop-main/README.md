# PCB design walk-through with KiCad

![Front render of the solder:bit Gamepad PCB](./renders/front.png)

## Workshop activity

You are given the task to complete the solder:bit Gamepad design with the remaining **tactile buttons** and **NeoPixels**.

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. In the [kicad](./kicad/) directory open project file `solderbit-gamepad.kicad_pro`, and begin with the Schematic Editor - follow the instructions in the red boxes to add the missing symbols.
3. Open the PCB Editor and update the changes from the schematic - move the footprints, route the components, fill zones, check DRCs, etc.
4. Generate Gerber files and the bill of materials (BOM) ready for manufacturing!

> Don’t worry if you don’t manage to get all the steps here completed! This activity is intended as a fun learning experience, introducing you to the world of PCB design.
