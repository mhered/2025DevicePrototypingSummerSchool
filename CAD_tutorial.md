pre made enclosures

3D printed laser cut

on demand manufacturing sheet metal bending, injection moulding etc

onshape:

* cloud native

* parametric can goback in history and update everything
* free (ish) but designs are public 

Other options: Fusion 360 (only Windows and Mac), FreeCAD, OpenScad

## Onshape concepts

Part Studios: cn define sketches, features and look at the History

Sketches: lines, fillets, dimensions, dimensions, constraints

Features: Sketchs, Planes, Extrusion

Parts

Design Timeline

Assemblies: more about placing and mating parts. Can add motion mating (e.g. rotate relative to each other)

If you over constrain a sketch it goes red. Many constrains are added automatically. Undo and notice when it sis snapping and say no

STEP files

geometric exchange format

can be exported from KiCAD

3D print the step of the PCBA as rapid prototype. Similarly with batteries etc.

Use the STEP files as context, no need to measure every dimension

Onshape has very good documentation
