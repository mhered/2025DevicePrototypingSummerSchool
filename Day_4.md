## Oliver Child - Printegrated Circuits

https://oliverchild.com/ | @oliverchildd

protopasta conductive material

printegrated circuit

prinjection to insert material in the through hole. custom Gcode

slicer postprocessing script uses the drill files

hand assemble up to 100 parts

let other people do the hard stuff. use modules

## Jack Burnett - accessible physical interface toolkit 

idea empower people to develop their own controllers by giving them tools

Reality:

1. nothing ever works

2. users rarely know what they want

3. progress comes in waves

## MakeDevice - James Hahn

micro:bit and jacdac

we plug a microbit and it primes the microcontrollers

virtual modules: precompiled subdesigns

gerber sockets 

Alpha version: https://makedevice.devices-lab.org/

## Prototyping with New and Emerging Materials - Jason Alexander

www.jasonalexander.kiwi @_kiwijason

no youtube tutorials, AI, forums or manuals... fail and try again persist to create somethin no one has done before

DeformIO force augmented display

Hydrohaptics - conveying haptic feedback through a soft interface with hydraulics and a deformable surface. You need a minimum volume for it to work

hydrogels, can add particles to change their properties e.g. change stiffness with temperature

## Airtied - Lukas Rambold

automatic personal fabrication of truss structures... inflatable !

single tube. automated constructions

A tool to build structures in sketchup

nylon fabric with TPU coating as used in life vests

## Emma

"Body doubling" - deliberately using the presence of others to motivate yourself 

mirroring or having accountability

## Jonathan Sanderson - Connect2 a research platform for family computational tinkering

Northumbria University - nustem

stegadonk

## Devices4Research - Heather (and John)

piggy back existing tech to support psychology studies in the wild

research ecosystem to monitor people: static for in situ, events, wearables based on micro:bit and MakeCode

rib:bit wearable GPS, RTC. Small, battery life

mikrobus click boards

dib:bit static device
